								<h2>Why I Chose Engineering</h2>
								</header>
								<p>I was very fortunate to have found my passion for engineering during my sophomore year in high school since, for many, it can be difficult to figure out what you want to pursue at an early age. For me, it became clear while learning AutoCAD and after traveling to BMW Headquarters in Munich, Germany.</p><p>Originally, I wanted to become an architect because of my fascination with the math and science that went into creating such magnificent buildings of ancient times. Between this and learning German throughout high school, the following summer I went on a two week long tour to Europe with classmates to visit different cities and attain a great cultural experience.</p><p>During our stay in Munich, we got to visit BMW's showroom. Upon seeing some of the world's highest performance vehicles at the time, engineering really grabbed hold of me. From then on, I knew my passion lied within engineering.</p><p>Now that I have gone through two years of engineering at university, I still hold strong onto that fervor. However, along the way I have grown to see that new technologies are only truly effective when it solves a problem and benefits society. This really became clear to me when I gained a great interest for Tesla Motors and their overarching mission for sustainability. Which is why, it is my goal to become part of a cause, if not leading it, and promote global change and innvoation. </p>
